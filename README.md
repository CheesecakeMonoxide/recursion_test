# recursion_test
This is an exercise in recursion that a friend gave me for practice. It finds the maximum value, minimum value, and depth of a nested list of values. It also suggests the best "move" or "path" to take as if you are playing against an opponent who wants to minimize your wins or maximize you loss at every turn. This is a practice set for the minimax tictactoe game I'm building.
